# Controls Guide

## Basic Controls
This document provides detailed information about how to interact with the A* Pathfinding Visualization.

### Mouse Controls
- **Left Click**: 
  - Place obstacles on the grid
  - Creates walls that the pathfinding algorithm must navigate around

- **Right Click**:
  - Remove obstacles from the grid
  - Erase previously placed walls

### Keyboard Controls
- **Space Bar**:
  - Starts the A* algorithm
  - Begins pathfinding visualization

- **C Key**:
  - Clears the entire grid
  - Removes all obstacles and the path
  - Resets to initial state

- **R Key**:
  - Resets the path
  - Keeps obstacles but clears the calculated path
  - Allows for new path calculation

## Tips
- Place obstacles before starting the algorithm
- Use Clear (C) if you want to start fresh
- Use Reset (R) to try different paths with the same obstacles
